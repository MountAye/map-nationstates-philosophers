[nation]MountAye[/nation] proudly presents the first [strike](and so far the only)[/strike] world map of the Philosophers region. This map is modified from a fan-made map for a strategic game [url=https://github.com/Gedemon/HK-GiantEarthMap]on GitHub[/url]. We appreciate their original work.

[b]What the map looks like[/b]
[list]
[*] https://www.nationstates.net/page=map/mid=1306.
[*] Oceans are blue; unoccupied continents are desert yellow.
[*] Oceans and continents are divided into various territories, as is in [url=https://github.com/MountAye/map-nationstates-philosophers/blob/main/images/registered.gif]this map[/url].
[*] Each nation takes up a few territories, the continental part of which will be painted a unique color, with a name on each connected area.
[/list]

[b]How to claim/join/expand[/b]
[list=1]
[*] Have a substantial presence: [list=1]
  [*] have a population ≥ 150 million;
  [*] be a resident of [region]Philosophers[/region] ≥ 1 week; 
  [*] have an active timeline.[/list]
[*] Accept that we have a quota of territories:
[list]
    [*] [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=faq#WA]World Assembly (WA)[/url] members can have [b][u]up to 5[/u][/b] territories.
    [*] non-WA members can have [b][u]only 1[/u][/b] territory. 
    [*] previously claimed territories remain the same, until it's changed by request, or recycled by rules below. 
[/list]
[*] Check out the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=map/mid=1306]regional map[/url] to see where no one has claimed.
[*] Check out the [url=https://github.com/MountAye/map-nationstates-philosophers/blob/main/images/registered.gif]base map[/url] to see the index number and name of the territories you have wanted.  
[*] [u]Send a telegram[/u] to [nation]MountAye[/nation], about the [b]territories[/b] and [b]color[/b] you'd like.
[*] Wait for the update. Click the "endorse" button at the bottom of the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=map/mid=1306]map page[/url], and you'll get a map button on your nation's home page.
[/list]

[b]What if I want some customization[/b]

Some people would like to play as countries smaller than a single territory, such as Switzerland. Therefore:
[list]
[*] Nations can ask to add new border lines to the base map. 
[*] Existing border lines cannot be moved or removed.
[*] Newly created territories also need to comply with the quota policy.
[*] If the customization affects territories that have been claimed, you need the permission from the corresponding nations.
[/list]

[b]How to disappear from the map[/b] 
[list]
[*] move to another region.
[*] cease to exist for a substantial amount of time.
[*] explicitly ask to be removed.
[*] be naughty (WA cheating to claim more territories, DoS attack, etc)
    [list]
        [*] When you resign from WA after claiming on the map, please tell me which territories you would like to forfeit; other wise I will shrink it as I like, without notice.
        [*] Resigning from WA immediately after claiming on the map will get you removed entirely.
    [/list]
